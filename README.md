Procedure of RST in the R code for typhoid fever prediction.

To perform appropriate RST, the R code follow the procedure below, after data set is loaded.
1. Discretize explanatory variable (X) and objective variable (Y)
Variables can be discretize equally, using quartile points, and to clearly classify Y.
2. Run RST
This process includes:
* Preparation of decision table
* Preparation of discernibility matrix
* Calculation of reduct
* Selection of reduct
* Preparation of decision table made with selected reduct
* Preparation of discernibility matrix made with selected reduct
* Deviation of rules
Reduct corresponds to selected variables.
